abstract: "Data on stocks and flows of international migration are necessary to understand migrant patterns and trends and to monitor and evaluate migration-relevant international development agendas. Many countries do not publish data on bilateral migration flows. At least six methods have been proposed recently to estimate bilateral migration flows between all origin-destination country pairs based on migrant stock data published by the World Bank and United Nations. We apply each of these methods to the latest available stock data to provide six estimates of five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2015. To assess the resulting estimates, we correlate estimates of six migration measures from each method with equivalent reported data where possible. Such systematic efforts at validation have largely been neglected thus far. We show that the correlation between the reported data and the estimates varies widely among different migration measures, over space, and over time. We find that the two methods using a closed demographic accounting approach perform consistently better than the four other estimation approaches."

<h2>Update for WPP2019</h2>
<p>This paper came out a day before the United Nations Population Division updated their World Population Prospects (WPP). This was unfortunate as all the estimates were based on WPP2017, which made the claim of our estimates being based on the most up to date input data was true for around one day only.</p>
<p>To rectify, I have added an updated set of estimates based on the WPP2019 to the <a href="https://figshare.com/collections/Bilateral_international_migration_flow_estimates_for_200_countries/4470464">Figshare collection</a>. Below is a quick summary of the changes in the updated estimates to those in the paper.</p>
<div id="comparison-of-estimates-based-on-wpp2017-and-wpp2019" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparison of estimates based on WPP2017 and WPP2019</h3>
<p>In the plot below are scatter charts of the bilateral estimates in each period and method (based on the two most recent WPP versions).</p>
<p><img src="/img/sd-compare1.png" /></p>
<p>For the stock differencing methods there are no changes in the estimates. They do not rely on WPP data. The migration rates approach uses the total absolute net migration data from WPP. All bilateral flows from WPP2019 are slightly higher than their WPP2017 counterparts, though it is barely noticeable in the plots above. The demographic accounting methods use the birth, death and population estimates from the WPP. In each method there are some sizable differences for the flows generated by updated revisions to the WPP demographic data.</p>
<p>These difference results in revisions to the overall totals of migration flows. Below is an animation of the changes to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0089-3#Fig2">Figure 2</a> in the paper</p>
<p><img src="/img/sd-est_tot.gif" /></p>
<p>From this plot, it is easier to see the changes in the migration rates estimation method. I was surprised that the changes in the estimates were occurring in all periods, not just the most recent period (2010-2015). To investigate I took a look at the changes in the WPP data.</p>

<h3>Which countries are most affected?</h3>
<p>The largest revisions in the demographic accounting methods, especially those based on the closed accounting approach, can be detected by looking at the changes in net migration between WPP2017 and WPP2019. Below are the time series of net migration in nine countries. These countries were the location of the largest absolute differences (in any period) in net migration.</p>
<p><img src="/img/sd-wpp_big_changes.gif" /></p>
<p>I was a bit surprised by the scale of the changes. In some periodâ€™s revisions to net migration are greater than a million. I dug a little deeper into net migraiton in previous WPP revisions to find that similar revisions have occured before. Below are the revisions of absolute net migration between past WPP versions that exceed one million (back to WPP2000, the earliest WPP data I can get my hands on).</p>

<h3>Impact on validation exercise</h3>
<p>The impact on the validation exercise is minimal. Below is an update of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0089-3#Fig4">Figure 4</a> in the paper.</p>
<p><img src="/img/sd-val_all.png" /></p>
<p>The correlations change by few tenths of decimal. These small changes are due to the limited amount of reported migration flows statistics (at the global level) to carry out our validation exercise. In these 45 countries that we used (from <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.asp">United Nations Population Division</a> the revisions in the WPP data were relatively minor, hence only small changes in their estimates and the correlations with the reported data.</p>
