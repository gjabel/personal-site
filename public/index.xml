      <description>Biography I am an applied statistician based at the Asian Demographic Research Institute and IIASA. I am also a Professor in the School of Sociology and Political Science at Shanghai University.
Previously I worked at the Vienna Institute of Demography, the ESRC Centre for Population Change and S3RI at the University of Southampton.
My day-to-day research covers estimating migration and applying statistical methods to better forecast components of population change. This website contains posts mainly related to my research, including some information on my publications and use of R.</description>

      <title>Animated Sankey Plots of Global Migrant Populations</title>
      <link>/post/animated-sankey/</link>

      <guid>/post/animated-sankey/</guid>
      <description>BackgroundSankey plots have been used to visualize bilateral migration many times. My favorite examples of Sankey plots for migration data tend to be when there are only few regions or countries. As the number of regions or countries increases the plot become more cumbersome, where labels for the smaller areas get too small and the plotting area becomes a very long rectangle making it awkward to fit on paper or view on the screen.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe tidycat package includes the tidy_categorical() function to expand broom::tidy() outputs for categorical parameter estimates.
DocumentationFor full documentation, see the package vignette: The tidycat package: expand broom::tidy() output for categorical parameter estimates
Hello WorldThe tidy() function in the broom package takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm(), and turns them into tidy data frames.

      <description>Over the last year or so I have been playing around with different ways of showing changing global bilateral migrant stocks, adapting the animation code I created for the plots for region to region flows in this estimation paper. I am putting them online here in case they are of interest to anyone else. Feel free to download the plots using right click over the animation and then Save Video as or from Github.</description>

      <description>We have had a number of requests for the R code to replicate the plots in our paper on internal migration in China. The code below will produce a similar looking plot, but I have taken out some of the arguments that were very specific to our plot that will not replicate well for other data.
DataThe code is based on two data sets:
Bilateral flow data with three columns only (origin, destination and flow), see here for the file used belowRegion details used for plotting, see here for the file used belowNote, the names in the region data are the same as the ones used in the origin and destination data.</description>

      <description>During the last few months I have given some introductory talks on international migration in Asia and Europe. I had a couple of requests to share the animated chord diagrams that I created for others to use in their teaching materials. These are below, along with some extra plots for Africa, the Americas (Northern, Central and Southern America as well as the Caribbean) and Oceania. Feel free to download the plots using right click over the animation and then Save Video as or from Github.</description>

      <description>BackgroundIâ€™m loving the magick package at the moment. Reading through the vignette I spotted the image_morph() function. In this post I experiment with the function to build the GIF below that shows the changes in the England football first kit over time, using images from the excellent Historical Football Kits website.
ScrapingThe Historical Football Kits website has a detailed section on England kits spread over six pages, starting from the first outfits used in 1872.</description>

      <description>Further Notes Below are some plots that I had to drop from the paper. Some reviewers liked them, reviewer three didnâ€™t. The editor sided with the later, making a good point; they distracted from the main narrative of the paper. I have put them here as 1) I think they still might be of interest to some and 2) it took some effort to gather the net migration data from as many past versions of the World Population Prospects (WPP) as I could get my hands on.</description>

      <description>BackgroundA little while ago my paper in International Migration Review on global migration flow estimates came out online. The paper includes a number of directional chord diagrams to visualize the estimates.
Recently I have been playing around tweenr and the magick packages for animated population pyramids. In this post I attempt to show how to use these packages to produce animated directional chord diagrams of global migration flow estimates</description>
